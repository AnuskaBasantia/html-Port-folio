<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>hello! <br> I'am Anuska Basantia.</p>

<p>I'm currently in my 2nd year of B.tech in CSE with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence & Machine learning!</p>

<p>I'am kind of a boring person,with some great hobbies which i really enjoy.<br>I love cooking and trying out new recipes and ofcourse not all of them turn out to be good but ya,I enjoy the process! I love reading books on murder mysteries and those detective books.I'm super duper proud of myself for making book reading as one of my hobby.
I love to make cute crafts,recently i tried painting on stones and they turned out to super preety and cute so i gifted them to my loved ones!(I hope they liked it too).<br>Talking more about me, I don't like parties, I'd love to stick to my bed 24x7! and I'm a die hard foodie!<br> And i really love gossiping!</p>
